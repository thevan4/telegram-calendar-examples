#  What this repository is for
A collection of examples of how to use the [library](https://github.com/thevan4/telegram-calendar).

There are too many interesting libraries that you just want to take and start using, not to read manuals on 100 pages ðŸ¥²

# Examples

- [Working as a separate http/grpc microservice](https://github.com/thevan4/telegram-calendar-examples/tree/main/standalone_service)
- [Simple example for telego](https://github.com/thevan4/telegram-calendar-examples/tree/main/mymmrac_telego/simplest_example)
- [Example for telego with separate microservice](https://github.com/thevan4/telegram-calendar-examples/tree/main/mymmrac_telego/with_standalone_service_example)

## TODO

- [ ] Write examples of use cases for go with 1-2 other popular libs
- [ ] Write an example standalone use case for python with some popular libs
